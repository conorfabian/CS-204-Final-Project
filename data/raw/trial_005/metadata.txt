Trial 005 Metadata
==================

TRIAL INFORMATION
- Trial Number: 005
- Trial Type: EXPERIMENTAL (with network shaping)
- Date: November 2025
- Time of Day: Evening
- Duration: 135 seconds

SYSTEM INFORMATION
- Operating System: macOS 14.x
- Browser: Google Chrome (latest stable)
- Chrome Profile: Isolated test profile
- Network Interface: Wi-Fi
- ISP: Residential broadband

VIDEO INFORMATION
- Platform: YouTube
- Video URL: [standard test video - same as previous trials]
- Video Length: >3 minutes
- Available Qualities: 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p

NETWORK CONFIGURATION
- Network Shaping: ENABLED (pfctl/dnctl)
- Phase 1 (0-45s): 20 Mbps, 40ms latency
- Phase 2 (45-90s): 1.5 Mbps, 40ms latency
- Phase 3 (90-135s): 20 Mbps, 40ms latency

NETWORK VERIFICATION
- pfctl status confirmed before trial
- dnctl pipes verified at each phase transition
- Manual bandwidth changes applied at T=45 and T=90

DATA COLLECTION
- Method: chrome://media-internals
- Quality recorded at: Multiple timestamps per phase
- Buffer recorded at: Multiple timestamps per phase

DATA FILES
- quality_timeline.csv: YES
- buffer_timeline.csv: YES
- observations.txt: YES

NOTES
- Third and final experimental trial
- Ran approximately 20 minutes after trial 004
- Showed most stressed buffer conditions (minimum 4.3s)
- Near-stall situation avoided by aggressive quality reduction
- Slowest recovery due to buffer-first priority
- Good example of ABR algorithm protecting against stalls
