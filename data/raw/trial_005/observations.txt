Trial 005 Observations - EXPERIMENTAL (With Network Shaping)
============================================================
Date: November 2025
Type: Experimental trial - standardized network trace applied
      Phase 1: 20 Mbps | Phase 2: 1.5 Mbps | Phase 3: 20 Mbps

PHASE 1 (0-45 seconds) - 20 Mbps bandwidth
- Started at 360p, took a bit longer to ramp up
- Reached 720p around T=19
- Stayed at 720p, did not reach 1080p before bandwidth change
- Buffer built to ~27 seconds

PHASE 2 (45-90 seconds) - 1.5 Mbps bandwidth DROP
- Bandwidth dropped at T=45
- Delayed response - stayed at 720p until T=54 (9 second delay)
- Quality progression: 720p -> 480p (T=61) -> 360p (T=79)
- Buffer got VERY low - minimum around 4.3 seconds at T=88
- This was the closest to a stall across all trials!
- Bitrate dropped to minimum of 756 kbps

PHASE 3 (90-135 seconds) - 20 Mbps RECOVERY
- Recovery started at T=90, but buffer was critically low
- Very slow initial recovery - stayed at 360p until T=105
- YouTube prioritized buffer over quality initially
- Quality increases: 360p -> 480p (T=105) -> 720p (T=127)
- Buffer recovered to ~26 seconds
- Did NOT return to peak quality in observation window

SUMMARY
- Total quality switches: 5
- Stalls/rebuffering: 0 (but VERY close at 4.3s buffer!)
- Maximum quality: 720p at 4123 kbps
- Minimum quality: 360p at 756 kbps
- Adaptation delay: ~9 seconds
- Recovery behavior: Very conservative due to low buffer
- Notes: This trial showed the most stress on the buffer.
         Came within seconds of a potential stall event.
         YouTube's ABR algorithm successfully prevented stalling
         by aggressively dropping quality. Recovery was slow
         because priority was rebuilding buffer safety margin.
         Interesting to note the delayed adaptation compared to
         trial 004 despite similar initial conditions.
