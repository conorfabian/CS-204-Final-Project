## Figure 1: Baseline Timeline (trial_001_timeline.png)
Two-panel timeline showing video bitrate (top) and buffer level (bottom) during baseline trial with no network shaping. Shows typical YouTube quality selection and buffer management under stable 20 Mbps conditions.

## Figure 2: Experimental Timeline (trial_003_timeline.png)
Two-panel timeline showing video bitrate (top) and buffer level (bottom) during experimental trial with network trace. Vertical dashed lines indicate bandwidth changes at 45s (drop to 1.5 Mbps) and 90s (recovery to 20 Mbps). Colored labels indicate network phase.

## Figure 3: Metrics Comparison (metrics_comparison.png)
Four-panel comparison of key performance metrics across all trials: (top-left) average bitrate delivered, (top-right) number of quality switches, (bottom-left) average buffer level, (bottom-right) percentage of time spent at each quality level shown as stacked bars.

## Figure 4: Bitrate Overlay (bitrate_overlay.png)
Overlay of video bitrate over time for all experimental trials, showing consistency (or variability) in YouTube's adaptation behavior under identical network conditions. Vertical lines mark bandwidth change points. Colored bands indicate network phase (blue=high, yellow=low, green=recovery).
